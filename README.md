## Mapping Numbers to Email
Phone numbers and emails are mapped in [Workers KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/), following the format below. The script searches for the sending number in the KV namespace and extracts the email to forward the message to.

| Key | Value |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| route:+11234567890  | {"mode":"forward_email","email":"jdoe@acme.com"}  |


`cachedNumberToEmail` is scoped to the module

`getNumberToEmailMap()` returns immediately after the first call because it is scoped to the module. It will return the already-parsed JSON
